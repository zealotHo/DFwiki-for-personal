    <p><a href="">房间价值 <em>room value</em></a> can be essential, whether it is a high-class <a href="">饭厅 <em>dining hall</em></a> for your dwarves or opulent throne rooms for your <a href="">贵族 <em>nobles</em></a>. Depending on what resources you have available, there are several ways to quickly <a href="">increase the value</a> of a room:</p>
    <h4>Mechanics</h4>
    <p>The new mechanics for tantrums are not well known yet. A dwarf throwing a tantrum will now keep misbehaving for several days, during which time they'll be a walking disaster zone. With the very slowly building and receding stress of DF2014, a dwarf will remain in a tantrum-capable state for months if not years. Since they'll usually snap about once per month, a single tantrummer can cause immense damage/carnage.</p>
    <h4>Damage Control</h4>
    <p>Highly stressed dwarves with tantrum propensity can (and maybe should) be locked up in a room with a bed, chair and table, away from further stressors and from people they can harm. If their stress exposure remains low enough for an extended time - months to years - they may recover and no longer throw tantrums. Their "cell" should be assigned as their bedroom and potentially dining room, and provisions must be stored in the room or delivered remotely. Since this is a very slow and laborious process, less caring overseers may opt for more radical "cures".</p>
    <p>Dwarves who develop stress should be watched carefully, to see if their personality makes them prone to tantrums. Due to the damage tantrums are likely to cause, keeping those dwarves away from further stress (or exposing them to increased danger to solve the problem in a different way) is highly recommended.</p>
    <h4>Prevention</h4>
    <p>Keeping your dwarves unstressed is an important task. There are many things that can cause stress to dwarves, and some dwarves just are more susceptible than others.</p>
    <p>Dwarves want a personal bedroom to sleep in and want a proper seat and table to eat at. Not providing them with these necessities causes regular stress increments.</p>
    <p>Being regularly exposed to the outside tends to be harmful to dwarves, since they'll either get unhappy over being out in the rain or, after a few years of mostly-underground fort life, become violently sick when exposed to sunlight. Catching sight of remains of sentient creatures, like the corpses left behind by goblin sieges will likewise cause strong stress to all but the most hardened dwarves.</p>
    <p>Limiting stressors appears to be the most important task for tantrum prevention in DF2014. Offering sources of happy thoughts - satisfying work, nice architecture, opportunities to mingle with friends and family - seem to help, but what a stress-susceptible dwarf needs most is the lack of further bad thoughts, not a glut of happy ones.</p>
